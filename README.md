# The UTFool Programming Language

UTFool /pron. as <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom right,
transparent 50%, black 50%, black 50%, transparent 50%)">b</div>eautiful/
is a Unicode-based object-oriented programming language designed
for trans-compilation to any other object-oriented source
(e.g. Java, JavaScript or Python).

UTFool is highly flexible on the lexical level.
_Keywords_, _delimiters_ and _operators_ are replaceable
by any unique sequence of symbols.
Besides of the usual forms of comments,
the UTFool source can contain _expletives_ and _aliases_
in order to increase readability.
UTFool does support language-specific solutions as well,
by allowing _embedded code_ fragments from the target language.

Defining your own vocabulary,
you can design your own programming dialect with UTFool.
In order to easily understand other sources,
you can translate them to your dialect.
Developer teams can use their common dialect, as a coding convention.
With UTFool you can be concise or eloquent, according to your style.
